*A Rust library for simulating Rocket League games at maximum efficiency*

A port of <https://github.com/ZealanL/RocketSim>. All the credit goes to Zealan for doing the hard work.

## What is this?

This repo is my attempt and simplifying and optimizing RocketSim.
It does not care for Bullet compatibility, and removes as many abstrations as possible.

This project is currently a massive WIP, and highly experimental.
Lots of features found in RocketSim are currently missing.
